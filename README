DESCRIPTION
    * $wordref = new Bad::Words qw(optional list of more words);
        This method converts all words in the combined lists to lower case,
        make the list unique, sorts it and returns a blessed reference.

          input:        optional list of additional bad words
          return:       reference to word list

    * $wordref = once Bad::Words qw(optional list of more words);
        This method performs the new operation once and on subsequent calls,
        it just returns the pre-computed reference.

          input:        optional list of additional bad words
          return:       reference to word list

    * $wordref = newthrd Bad::Words qw(optional list of words);
        WARNING: once and new store the list reference in lexical variable
        in the module. newthrd does not do this. once returns the stored
        variable if it is initialized. If you want thread safe, do not use
        once and new.

        This method recalculates the list on every call.

          input:        optional list of additional bad words
          return:       reference to word list

    * $count = $wordref->count;
        This method returns the number of unique words in the bad word list.

          input:        none
          return:       number of words
